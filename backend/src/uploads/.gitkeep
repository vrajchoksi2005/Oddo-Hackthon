# Uploads Directory

This directory is used for temporary file storage during image upload processing.

Files uploaded here are processed and then uploaded to Cloudinary before being cleaned up from local storage.

**Note**: This directory should be included in your .gitignore file to avoid committing uploaded files to version control.
